# Abdullah Hamad

I am currently a Software Engineering student at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln and I will be graduating in May 2023. I have about two years of exprience working as a full stack developer at Nobl Health. I also have experience working on two year-long projects with real companies as a part of senior design, one of which you can see the work I did here in this repoistory ([RNAMake Portal React Frontend](https://github.com/ahamad2/rnamake-portal-frontend)). I enjoy working with others and finding out about their passions and what they do.
